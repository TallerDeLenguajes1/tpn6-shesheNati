    _ String es un tipo por referencia
     
    \' – single quote, needed for character literals
    \" – double quote, needed for string literals
    \\ – backslash
    \0 – Unicode character 0
    \a – Alert(character 7)
    \b – Backspace(character 8)
    \f – Form feed(character 12)
    \n – New line(character 10)
    \r – Carriage return (character 13)
    \t – Horizontal tab(character 9)
    \v – Vertical quote(character 11)
    \uxxxx – Unicode escape sequence for character with hex value xxxx
    \xn[n][n][n] – Unicode escape sequence for character with hex value nnnn(variable length version of \uxxxx)
    \Uxxxxxxxx – Unicode escape sequence for character with hex value xxxxxxxx(for generating surrogates)



    The advantage of @-quoting is that escape sequences are not processed, which makes it easy to write, for example, a fully qualified file name:
    @"c:\Docs\Source\a.txt" // rather than "c:\\Docs\\Source\\a.txt"
